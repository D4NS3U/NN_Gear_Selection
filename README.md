Repository for university project about NN for gear selection.

The directory 'Understanding LSTMs' is a conglomerate of LSTM network examples found in the internet and remade by me.
The files there have no direct relation to the other files and directories in this repository

The two files CatMatFiles and SeqShiftPoints are used to alterate given series' of measurements to a format usable for neural networks.

2. Execute one of the two files stated above.
3. Your prepared data is in TRAINING/OUTPUT respectivley TEST/OUTPUT directory.
